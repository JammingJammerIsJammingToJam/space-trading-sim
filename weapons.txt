We need different weapons and tiers. we may also need armour and items to upgrade or go alongside these. We could also have weapons that are exclusive to machines and humans and
that can be mounted on the spaceship. Edit this file if you have any reasonable ideas.
This is my weapon prototype that won't be used in the final game.

Jamming Here: This is irrelevant and not on topic and so will not be utilised in the game. Further Ideas must be on Topic. You don't use a twig from a spaceship.

10 damage
1 second cooldown
ability:block hits
melee weapon
Can upgrade into the following:
-Axe
-Sword
-Trident
-Spear
